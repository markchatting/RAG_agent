RAG Agent


**Privacy Policy for RAG agent**

**Effective Date:** 17th March 2025  

**1. Introduction**  
RAG agent ("the Application") is a private application developed for personal use as an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent**. The Application operates within **Google Cloud** and accesses a specific folder on **Google Drive** to retrieve and process data. This Privacy Policy outlines how the Application handles data, access permissions, and security measures.

---

### **2. Data Access and Collection**
The Application requires access to a specific folder on Google Drive to perform its retrieval-augmented generation functions. The types of data accessed include:
- Documents and files stored within the specified folder.
- Metadata associated with files, such as file names and timestamps.

The Application does **not** collect or process data outside of the designated folder.

---

### **3. Purpose of Data Usage**
The accessed data is used exclusively for:
- Retrieving relevant content to generate responses within the Application.
- Enhancing response accuracy using retrieval-augmented generation.
- Performing natural language processing and AI-driven data interpretation.

The Application does **not** share, sell, or transfer any accessed data to third parties.

---

### **4. Data Storage and Security**
- The Application does not store any retrieved data persistently beyond the runtime session.
- Google Cloud security mechanisms, including authentication and access control, are implemented to protect data integrity.
- OAuth 2.0 authentication is used to request and manage access to Google Drive.
- Data transmission occurs over **encrypted channels (HTTPS/SSL)** to prevent unauthorized interception.

---

### **5. User Authentication and Permissions**
The Application uses Google OAuth authentication to request permission for Google Drive access. Users are required to grant:
- **Read-only or read-write** access (as configured) to a specific folder.
- Consent via Google’s permission request flow before data retrieval.

Users may **revoke** access at any time through their **Google Account settings**.

---

### **6. Third-Party Services**
The Application operates within Google Cloud and does not rely on external third-party services for processing user data. However, it leverages **Google Drive API** for file retrieval and **Google Cloud AI tools** for RAG operations.

---

### **7. Data Retention Policy**
- No data is stored permanently within the Application.
- All retrieved data is processed in real-time and discarded upon session termination.
- Logs related to API calls and system activity are maintained solely for debugging and performance monitoring within Google Cloud.

---

### **8. User Control and Opt-Out**
Since this Application is for private use, only the authorized user (developer) can:
- Modify access permissions within Google Cloud.
- Restrict or expand the scope of data retrieval.
- Discontinue the Application’s operation at any time.

---

### **9. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be updated with a new **Effective Date**. Since this Application is for personal use, policy changes will only be documented for internal reference.
